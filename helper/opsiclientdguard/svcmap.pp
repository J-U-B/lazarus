Automatic:
Indicates that the service is to be started (or was started) by the operating system, at system start-up. If an automatically started service depends on a manually started service, the manually started service is also started automatically at system startup.

Disabled:
Indicates that the service is disabled, so that it cannot be started by a user or application.

Manual:
Indicates that the service is started only manually, by a user (using the Service Control Manager) or by an application.

System
Indicates that the service is a device driver started by the IOInitSystem function. This value is valid only for device drivers.
